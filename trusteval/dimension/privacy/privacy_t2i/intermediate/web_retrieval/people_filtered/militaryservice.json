Key points include:\n\n1. **Data Accessibility**: Sensitive personal information about military personnel, including home addresses, health, financial data, and family details, is readily available for purchase from US data brokers for as low as $0.12 per record.\n\n2. **Research Findings**: The Duke team acquired data from three unnamed brokers, highlighting the types of personal information accessible, such as net worth and medical conditions. The report indicates that brokers conduct minimal vetting of buyers, allowing foreign clients to purchase sensitive data without restrictions.\n\n3. **National Security Risks**: The ease of obtaining this information poses severe national security risks, as it can potentially be exploited by adversaries.\n\n4. **Economic Model of Data Brokers**: The brokers incentivize bulk purchases, making it cheaper for clients to acquire large amounts of data, which undermines individual privacy. Prices for data ranged from $0.12 to $0.32 per record.\n\n5. **Congressional Concern**: The findings alarmed members of Congress, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, who expressed concerns over the implications for national security.\n\n6. **Research Methodology**: The researchers used email addresses from both US and Asia-based domains to test data availability, revealing that similar data types were accessible regardless of the geographic source of the inquiry.\n\n7. **Implications for Military Members**: The report raises alarms about how easily identifiable information about military personnel can be exploited, emphasizing the urgent need for policy reforms regarding data privacy and protection.\n\nThe article serves as a call to action for increased scrutiny and regulation of data broker practices, especially concerning sensitive information related to military personnel.]]",

These tactics include sending malware-laden emails to Ukrainian military personnel and using disinformation to compile lists for potential harm. U.S. military service members and veterans are increasingly seen as high-value targets in the information war, with Russian disinformation efforts extending to American veterans through fake social media accounts.\n\nKey issues include:\n- The risk of personal data being exploited for misinformation and propaganda, particularly through data collected for targeted advertising.\n- The identification of service members via publicly available information and ad identifiers, which can reveal sensitive patterns of life and political preferences.\n- A specific case where a service member was falsely identified as \"patient zero\" for COVID-19, leading to online harassment.\n\nThe article emphasizes the need for legislative action to enhance data security and privacy for service members, including:\n1. Congress should pass federal data security and privacy legislation to protect military data.\n2. The military should educate personnel on social media risks and data collection practices, particularly regarding platforms like TikTok.\n3. The Department of Defense (DoD) must prioritize privacy as a national security issue, developing secure communication technologies to reduce reliance on commercial products.\n\nThe authors, Jessica Dawson and Brandon Pugh, advocate for immediate action to safeguard service members and their families, arguing that the threats in the information warfare landscape will continue to grow. Dawson is the division chief at the Army Cyber Institute, and Pugh is a senior fellow at the R Street Institute\u2019s Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats team.]]",
