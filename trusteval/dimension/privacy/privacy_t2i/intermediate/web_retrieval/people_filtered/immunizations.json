The authors include Lara A. Heersema, Luke Cunniff, Amanda L. Eiden, Isha Sharma, Jaya Mishra, and Alexandra Bhatti.\n\n**Background**: Immunization Information Systems (IIS) are confidential, population-based databases that track vaccinations administered to individuals within specific geopolitical areas. The study highlights the evolution of IIS policy over the last two decades, emphasizing their importance in achieving equitable vaccine uptake.\n\n**Methods**: Legal epidemiological research methods were employed to assess IIS statutes and administrative codes across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Philadelphia, and New York City. The study compared current laws with previous legal assessments to identify trends.\n\n**Results**: The study compiled current laws, revealing diverse interstate and intrastate policies that govern IIS capabilities and implementation. Key findings include:\n- 98% of jurisdictions can collect vaccination data for all ages, except Connecticut, which focuses on children.\n- 83% of jurisdictions require certain providers to report pediatric vaccinations.\n- 72% require some reporting of adult vaccinations.\n- 28% of jurisdictions do not allow for opting out of pediatric data inclusion in IIS.\n- 75% of jurisdictions permit intrastate data sharing, while only 42% allow interstate data sharing.\n- 81% of jurisdictions recognize IIS as valid proof of vaccination for school or childcare entry.\n- 62% mandate certain demographic data reporting in the IIS.\n\n**Conclusions**: IIS are managed at state and local levels, leading to variability in policies and implementation. The study serves as a benchmark for current IIS laws and can assist stakeholders in exploring policy amendments. It underscores the need for improved data collection, interoperability, and access to maximize the potential of IIS in public health.\n\n**Limitations**: The study did not include surveys or interviews with jurisdictions operating IIS, and it may not capture all programmatic policies.\n\n**Funding**: The research was funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, with authors acknowledging potential conflicts of interest due to employment with the company.\n\n**Keywords**: Immunization Information Systems, Vaccines, Public Health, Health Information Systems, Health Policy, Legal Study.]]",

        "summary": "[[Summary: \nThe article titled \"Privacy and artificial intelligence: challenges for protecting health information in a new era,\" authored by Blake Murdoch and published in BMC Medical Ethics on September 15, 2021, discusses the rapid advancements in healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) and the associated privacy concerns regarding patient health information. \n\nKey Points:\n1. **Background**: The integration of AI in healthcare is accelerating, with technologies nearing real-world application, particularly in fields like radiology and diabetic retinopathy detection. The FDA has approved AI applications for clinical care.\n\n2. **Ownership and Control**: Many AI technologies are controlled by private entities, raising concerns about the access, use, and control of patient data. Public-private partnerships have sometimes failed to protect privacy adequately, highlighting the need for systemic oversight.\n\n3. **Privacy Breaches**: There is an increased risk of privacy breaches due to advanced algorithms that can potentially re-identify anonymized patient data. Studies indicate that sophisticated computational methods can identify individuals in datasets that have been scrubbed of identifiers.\n\n4. **Public Trust**: A survey revealed that only 11% of Americans are willing to share health data with tech companies, compared to 72% willing to share with physicians. This indicates a significant lack of trust in tech companies regarding data security.\n\n5. **Regulatory Challenges**: Current regulations are lagging behind technological advancements, necessitating a focus on patient agency, consent, and improved data anonymization methods. The regulatory landscape varies globally, with the U.S. and Canada lacking comprehensive frameworks specific to AI.\n\n6. **Recommendations**: The article suggests that regulations should foster patient agency and consent, ensure data remains within its jurisdiction, and encourage the use of generative data to mitigate privacy concerns. \n\n7. **Conclusion**: While AI has the potential to improve healthcare significantly, the challenges surrounding privacy and data protection are substantial and require urgent attention to safeguard patient information in the evolving landscape of healthcare technology.\n\nOverall, the article emphasizes the pressing need for robust privacy protections and regulatory frameworks to keep pace with the rapid development of AI in healthcare.]]",
