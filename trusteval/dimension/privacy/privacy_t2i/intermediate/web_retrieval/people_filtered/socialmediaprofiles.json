Social media allows for both positive outcomes (e.g., increased social capital) and negative consequences (e.g., privacy breaches).\n\n2. **Privacy Framework**: The authors propose a framework that categorizes privacy into five boundary types\u2014relational, network, territorial, disclosure, and interactional. These boundaries help users manage their privacy in social media contexts.\n\n3. **Historical Trends**: Social media usage has surged over the past two decades, with a significant increase in users and daily engagement. For example, as of 2019, 72% of U.S. adults were using social media, with platforms like Facebook having 2.41 billion monthly users.\n\n4. **Privacy Challenges**: The chapter identifies several key privacy challenges:\n   - **Information Disclosure**: Managing who sees what information is a primary concern for users.\n   - **Context Collapse**: The merging of different social circles can lead to unintended audiences seeing personal information.\n   - **Reputation Management**: Users curate their online identities to manage how they are perceived.\n   - **Access to Oneself**: Users struggle with controlling their availability and accessibility to others.\n\n5. **Privacy Paradox**: The chapter discusses the privacy paradox, where users express concerns about privacy yet engage in behaviors that contradict those concerns, often due to a lack of understanding of privacy settings or social pressures.\n\n6. **Interpersonal Boundary Regulation**: Privacy is reconceptualized as a dynamic process of boundary regulation rather than a simple act of withholding information. This involves balancing the need for interaction with the desire for privacy.\n\n7. **Tools and Recommendations**: The authors provide tools for assessing privacy concerns and emphasize the importance of designing privacy features that account for individual differences in user behavior and expectations.\n\n8. **Social Disenfranchisement**: The chapter highlights how privacy concerns can lead to social disenfranchisement, particularly among vulnerable populations who may avoid social media due to fears of harassment or negative social interactions.\n\n9. **Future Directions**: The authors call for ongoing research and design efforts that prioritize user privacy, considering the evolving nature of social media and the diverse needs of its users.\n\nOverall, the chapter underscores the necessity for researchers and practitioners to address privacy in social media through a nuanced understanding of interpersonal dynamics and boundary management.]]",

It introduces privacy fatigue as a mediating factor and regulatory focus as a moderating variable. \n\n**Key Findings:**\n1. **Privacy Invasion and Protection Intentions:** Previous experiences of privacy invasion increase users' intentions to protect their privacy.\n2. **Role of Privacy Fatigue:** Privacy fatigue mediates the relationship between privacy invasion experiences and protection intentions. Increased privacy invasion experiences and associated response costs lead to higher privacy fatigue, which in turn decreases privacy protection intentions.\n3. **Regulatory Focus:** Individuals with a promotion focus experience less privacy fatigue than those with a prevention focus, moderating the impact of privacy invasion experiences on privacy fatigue.\n\n**Methodology:**\n- The study utilized a sample of 4,800 participants from China, gathered through an online survey.\n- It constructed a moderated chain mediation model based on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and Regulatory Focus Theory.\n\n**Statistical Analysis:**\n- Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the reliability and validity of the scales used.\n- The PROCESS macro for SPSS was employed to analyze the moderated mediation model.\n\n**Theoretical Contributions:**\n- The research extends PMT by incorporating emotional factors (privacy fatigue) into the analysis of privacy protection behaviors.\n- It highlights the importance of individual psychological traits (regulatory focus) in shaping responses to privacy invasions.\n\n**Practical Implications:**\n- Recommendations for improving online privacy environments include enhancing regulatory measures and reducing response costs related to privacy protection.\n- Emphasis on privacy literacy, especially for prevention-focused individuals, is crucial.\n\n**Limitations and Future Directions:**\n- The study suggests further exploration of different types of privacy invasions and their varying impacts.\n- It acknowledges the need for research on user perceptions across different social media platforms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe study concludes that privacy invasion experiences increase protection intentions through heightened response costs but are masked by privacy fatigue. Regulatory focus influences the extent of privacy fatigue experienced by users, suggesting targeted interventions to enhance privacy protection behavior. \n\n**Keywords:** social media, privacy invasion, privacy protection, regulatory focus, privacy fatigue]]",
