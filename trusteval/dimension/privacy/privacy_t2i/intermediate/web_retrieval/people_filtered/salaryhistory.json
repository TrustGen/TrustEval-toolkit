If a significant portion of compensation comes from commissions or bonuses, overall compensation estimates must be provided.\n\n**Expert Opinions:**\n- Robert Sheen, CEO of Trusaic, emphasizes that these measures promote pay equity, leading to increased job satisfaction and improved performance.\n- Shard\u00e9 Skahan, partner at Seyfarth Shaw LLP, notes that this executive order reflects a serious commitment to pay equity and could inspire similar laws across the nation.\n- Joy Rosenquist from Littler highlights that contractors must clearly communicate pay ranges and compensation details to potential applicants.\n\n**Preparation for Compliance:**\nEmployers should:\n- Review and update pay-related policies.\n- Conduct a pay equity analysis.\n- Develop an action plan to address any identified pay gaps.\n- Train HR personnel on the new compliance requirements.\n\n**Conclusion:** The executive order is a significant step towards enhancing pay equity in federal employment and may lead to broader changes in salary history practices across various jurisdictions. \n\n**Resource Reference:** Pay Equity Law by State \u2014 Are You in Compliance?]]\n\n",
