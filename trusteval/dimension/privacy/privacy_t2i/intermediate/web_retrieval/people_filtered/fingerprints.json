        "summary": "[[Summary: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a policy statement on May 18, 2023, addressing the misuse of biometric information and its potential harm to consumers. The statement highlights the significant privacy and data security concerns associated with the growing use of biometric technologies, including facial, iris, and fingerprint recognition. Samuel Levine, Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, emphasized the sophistication and pervasiveness of biometric surveillance, which poses threats to privacy and civil rights.\n\nThe policy statement outlines that companies must comply with the law regarding the collection and use of biometric information, warning against unfair or deceptive practices. It notes that consumers face increasing risks, such as the potential revelation of sensitive personal information and the attractiveness of biometric databases to malicious actors. Additionally, certain biometric technologies may exhibit higher error rates for specific populations.\n\nThe FTC has previously taken enforcement actions against companies like Everalbum and Facebook for misrepresenting their use of facial recognition technology. The agency's policy statement also warns that making false claims about the accuracy of biometric technologies could violate the FTC Act. Factors considered in assessing unfair practices include the failure to assess foreseeable harms, addressing known risks, unexpected data collection, and inadequate training for employees handling biometric information.\n\nThe Commission voted 3-0 to adopt this policy statement, with FTC staff members Robin Wetherill and Amanda Koulousias involved in its development. The FTC aims to promote competition and protect consumers, urging individuals to report fraud and scams through their platforms.]]",

These biometric identifiers are permanent and cannot be easily changed if compromised, unlike credit card numbers or email addresses. The piece emphasizes the need for limited collection of biometric data, especially in light of increased vulnerabilities due to digital storage and transmission.\n\nKey points include:\n- Biometric data is sensitive and permanent, making it difficult for individuals to regain control once breached.\n- Regulatory proposals, like the one in Austin requiring ridesharing drivers to be fingerprinted, aim to ensure safety but may not be the most effective or least intrusive methods.\n- Many government agencies collect unnecessary biometric data, raising questions about the need and safety of such practices.\n- Historical context highlights that fingerprinting was once done manually and stored physically, but modern digital methods increase risks of unauthorized access.\n- The article advocates for promoting safety without collecting new data, suggesting alternatives like comprehensive background checks or interviews.\n- Governments should strive to collect minimal data while achieving their regulatory goals to protect individual privacy.\n\nThe article concludes with a call for policymakers to consider privacy-protective regulations when designing programs that affect individual security.
