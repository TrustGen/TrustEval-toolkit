The Impact of Salary History Bans on Employment\n\n**Author:** Ting Zhai\n\n**Affiliations:** \n- School of Humanities, Southeast University, Nanjing, China\n- School of Management, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China\n\n**Journal Information:**\n- **Journal:** Journal of Government and Economics\n- **Volume & Issue:** Vol. 15, p. 100117\n- **ISSN:** 2667-3193 (Online)\n- **Publisher:** Elsevier\n- **Country of Publisher:** Netherlands\n- **Publication Date:** January 2024\n\n**Abstract:** \nThe paper investigates the impact of salary history bans on employment levels, amidst a debate over confidential versus transparent pay. As several U.S. states and counties have enacted policies prohibiting employers from inquiring about historical pay, major tech companies like Apple have adopted similar policies. The study utilizes a staggered difference-in-differences method to analyze county-level panel data from 2013 to 2021, treating the salary history ban as a quasi-natural experiment. The findings suggest that the salary history ban does not lead to a significant increase in employment levels; in fact, it appears to reduce employment in local firms by an average of 1.04% compared to firms in areas without such policies. The paper offers empirical evidence on the effects of salary history bans and suggests considerations for enhancing corporate payroll management systems.\n\n**Keywords:** Salary history ban, Staggered difference-in-differences method, Employment\n\n**Website:** [Journal of Government and Economics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-government-and-economics)\n\n**Legal Information:** Content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license.

Agan, Bo Cowgill, and Laura K. Gee. In 21 US states, it is illegal for employers to ask candidates about their salary histories, though candidates can voluntarily disclose this information. The study focused on software engineers and found that not disclosing salary history led to lower salary offers for both men and women. \n\nThe researchers created 2,048 fictional job applications with standardized characteristics, including education and experience, and randomized biographical details such as gender and salary disclosure. The applicants' previous salaries were set between the 25th and 75th percentiles of their prior employers' salary scales, with a built-in gender wage gap of 15% favoring men.\n\nRecruiters evaluated these applications, recommending interview calls and salary offers. Results showed that recruiters made negative inferences about candidates who did not disclose their salaries, especially men, assuming their salaries were at or below the 25th percentile. Disclosing salary history resulted in higher mean recommended salaries ($103,993 vs. $96,521 for nondisclosers), with recruiters estimating outside offers for disclosers to be 9% higher.\n\nThe study highlighted that employers adjusted their perceptions based on salary history, with a nuanced approach to gender wage gaps. Disclosing salary could signal candidate quality but might lead to lower salary offers if candidates are perceived as having strong competing offers. The findings suggest trade-offs for candidates, employers, and policymakers regarding the use and regulation of salary history information. \n\nKey researchers involved: Amanda Y. Agan, Bo Cowgill, Laura K. Gee. Relevant topics include labor economics, labor discrimination, and personnel economics.]]",
