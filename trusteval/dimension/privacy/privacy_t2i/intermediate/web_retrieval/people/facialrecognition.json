        "summary": "[[Summary: The article discusses the implications of facial recognition technology, particularly focusing on the app developed by Clearview AI, which was launched in 2017. Tech reporter Kashmir Hill highlights the ethical concerns surrounding the app, which uses a database of 30 billion photos scraped from social media without consent. Hill's book, \"Your Face Belongs to Us,\" chronicles the company's practices and the potential for misuse of the technology, including wrongful arrests and harassment.\n\nKey points include:\n- Clearview AI's app allows identification of individuals from pictures, raising significant privacy and civil liberties concerns.\n- The company, led by Hoan Ton-That, has faced fines in Europe and Australia for privacy violations.\n- Hill emphasizes the lack of comprehensive federal privacy regulations in the U.S. to address the challenges posed by such technologies.\n- The app has been utilized by law enforcement, including in identifying participants in the January 6 Capitol riots.\n- Hill and Harvard professor Jonathan Zittrain discuss the complex ethical questions regarding the use of Clearview for law enforcement versus privacy rights.\n- Other facial recognition apps, like PimEyes, also exist, with similar capabilities but less public scrutiny.\n- Hill advocates for new laws to protect privacy rights, drawing parallels to historical regulations against wiretapping and citing existing laws like Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).\n- The article concludes with Hill's assertion that technology should not dictate societal norms and emphasizes the need for proactive legal frameworks to safeguard individual privacy.]]\n\n",

The report recommends that the federal government take action to address privacy, equity, and civil liberties issues associated with FRT.\n\nKey Findings:\n- FRT is increasingly used for identity verification and identification, with applications ranging from unlocking smartphones to aiding law enforcement.\n- The technology utilizes trained AI models to create biometric templates from facial images, comparing them for identification purposes.\n- Despite its benefits, the report emphasizes that the U.S. lacks comprehensive regulations governing the use of FRT, leading to potential infringements on privacy and civil liberties.\n\nConcerns Raised:\n- FRT can facilitate surveillance and create detailed records of individuals' movements, particularly in the hands of repressive regimes.\n- The technology may disproportionately affect marginalized communities, as many systems are trained on datasets that underrepresent racial minorities, leading to higher false positive rates for these groups.\n- The report identifies two main categories of concern: problematic use/misuse of FRT and inherent errors or limitations within the technology itself.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. The Executive Office of the President should consider issuing an executive order to establish guidelines for FRT use in federal agencies, addressing equity and privacy concerns.\n2. New federal legislation should be developed to limit the potential harms of FRT, including:\n   - Restrictions on storing facial images and templates.\n   - Training and certification requirements for operators.\n   - Regulations on the use of FRT for surveillance and other sensitive applications.\n3. Establish industry standards for FRT, including data security and accuracy benchmarks, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a central authority.\n4. Federal working groups should be formed to develop standards for equitable use by law enforcement, focusing on transparency and redress for misuse.\n\nThe study was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The National Academies operate under a congressional charter and aim to provide independent analysis to inform public policy on science and technology issues.]]",
