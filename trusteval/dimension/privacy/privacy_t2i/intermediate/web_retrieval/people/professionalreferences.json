        "summary": "[[Summary: \nOn October 19, 2022, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, Ana Brian Nougr\u00e8res, presented a report to the General Assembly highlighting the increasing challenges to privacy in the digital era. Nougr\u00e8res emphasized that new digital technologies that process personal information often violate individuals' reasonable expectations of privacy. She stated that while technology has been beneficial for development, it poses significant risks regarding privacy.\n\nThe report outlined that privacy is a fundamental human right that enables personal development and the exercise of rights in accordance with human dignity. Nougr\u00e8res urged states to adopt the principles laid out in her report as essential components of national legal systems governing the processing of personal data. These principles include legality, consent, transparency, purpose, loyalty, proportionality, minimization, quality, responsibility, and security. \n\nShe called for international cooperation and regulatory harmonization to address the challenges of personal data processing and to safeguard privacy rights globally. Nougr\u00e8res noted that commonalities in international normative documents could help achieve a global consensus on privacy protection.\n\nFurthermore, she acknowledged the need for civilization to evolve alongside technological advancements while respecting human dignity and freedom. Nougr\u00e8res was appointed as Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy in July 2021, and she is a law professor and practicing attorney specializing in data protection and privacy.\n\nFor more information, media inquiries can be directed to Sonia Cronin at the UN Human Rights Office. The UN encourages individuals to advocate for human rights through initiatives like #Standup4humanrights.\n]]",

The paper also proposes a roadmap for addressing privacy concerns related to employee data used in HR analytics.\n\n**Keywords:** HR analytics, Data, Data breach, Privacy, GDPR  \n\n**1. Introduction:**  \n- Privacy and security are fundamental human rights recognized by the United Nations (UNO) since 1948.\n- Employers have greater access to personal information about employees compared to other entities, increasing the risk of data breaches.\n- HR departments are responsible for safeguarding employee data, which is increasingly utilized in HR analytics, raising privacy concerns.\n\n**2. Related Work:**  \n- HR analytics data is critical for organizations, necessitating careful data management.\n- GDPR, enacted in 2018, aims to protect data privacy and has influenced global data protection laws.\n- Various countries, including Singapore and Canada, have established laws for data protection, like the Personal Data Protection Act and the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act, respectively.\n\n**3. Findings and Discussion:**  \n- Data breaches can lead to severe consequences for individuals, including identity theft and financial loss.\n- Internal and external threats to data privacy are prevalent, with 55% of enterprises experiencing data breaches in the past year.\n- Organizations must implement robust data governance practices, including employee training, data encryption, and strict access controls.\n- Examples of significant data breaches include incidents at Boeing, Morrisons, Equifax, and the FDIC, highlighting the need for improved data protection measures.\n\n**4.
