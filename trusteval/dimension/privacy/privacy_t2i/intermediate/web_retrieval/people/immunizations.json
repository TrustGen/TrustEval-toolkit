The authors include Lara A. Heersema, Luke Cunniff, Amanda L. Eiden, Isha Sharma, Jaya Mishra, and Alexandra Bhatti.\n\n**Background**: Immunization Information Systems (IIS) are confidential, population-based databases that track vaccinations administered to individuals within specific geopolitical areas. The study highlights the evolution of IIS policy over the last two decades, emphasizing their importance in achieving equitable vaccine uptake.\n\n**Methods**: Legal epidemiological research methods were employed to assess IIS statutes and administrative codes across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Philadelphia, and New York City. The study compared current laws with previous legal assessments to identify trends.\n\n**Results**: The study compiled current laws, revealing diverse interstate and intrastate policies that govern IIS capabilities and implementation. Key findings include:\n- 98% of jurisdictions can collect vaccination data for all ages, except Connecticut, which focuses on children.\n- 83% of jurisdictions require certain providers to report pediatric vaccinations.\n- 72% require some reporting of adult vaccinations.\n- 28% of jurisdictions do not allow for opting out of pediatric data inclusion in IIS.\n- 75% of jurisdictions permit intrastate data sharing, while only 42% allow interstate data sharing.\n- 81% of jurisdictions recognize IIS as valid proof of vaccination for school or childcare entry.\n- 62% mandate certain demographic data reporting in the IIS.\n\n**Conclusions**: IIS are managed at state and local levels, leading to variability in policies and implementation. The study serves as a benchmark for current IIS laws and can assist stakeholders in exploring policy amendments. It underscores the need for improved data collection, interoperability, and access to maximize the potential of IIS in public health.\n\n**Limitations**: The study did not include surveys or interviews with jurisdictions operating IIS, and it may not capture all programmatic policies.\n\n**Funding**: The research was funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, with authors acknowledging potential conflicts of interest due to employment with the company.\n\n**Keywords**: Immunization Information Systems, Vaccines, Public Health, Health Information Systems, Health Policy, Legal Study.]]",

MacDonald (Dalhousie University, Canada), M. Carolina Danovaro-Holliday (WHO, Switzerland), Jaleela Jawad (Ministry of Health, Bahrain)\n\n**Publication Date:** October 27, 2020\n\n**DOI:** 10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.09.017\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n- Concerns regarding the quality and utilization of immunization and vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance data have persisted for over 20 years.\n- A Working Group (WG) was established by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in August 2017 to assess and enhance the quality and use of immunization data.\n- WG findings presented in October 2019 indicated improvements since 2011 but highlighted ongoing gaps in data quality and utilization, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\n- Sustainable improvements require better governance, workforce capacity, tools, and processes to ensure data is fit-for-purpose and utilized effectively.\n\n**Main Findings:**\n1. **Data Quality (DQ) Definition:** DQ is defined as data that are accurate, precise, relevant, complete, and timely for intended purposes.\n2. **Data Use Definition:** Data use refers to the degree to which data are utilized for defined purposes such as program management and decision-making.\n3. **Challenges Identified:**\n   - Many interventions have targeted national or subnational levels rather than focusing on local data collection.\n   - Significant gaps exist in data quality, particularly in LMICs, due to inadequate reporting practices and tools.\n   - Inaccurate denominators for vaccination coverage calculations were a common issue.\n4. **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n   - Embed monitoring of data quality and use into routine immunization and VPD surveillance.\n   - Enhance workforce capacity and capability for data management, starting at the facility level.\n   - Improve the accuracy of immunization program targets.\n   - Encourage the use of existing data for tailored program actions.\n   - Adopt a data-driven continuous quality improvement approach.\n\n**Emerging Issues:**\n- The need for accurate population estimates and the inclusion of private-sector data.\n- Transitioning from infant vaccination to a life-course vaccination approach.\n- Developing indicators for monitoring immunization inequalities.\n\n**Governance and Capacity Building:**\n- Strong policies and accountability mechanisms are essential for effective data governance.\n- Capacity-building efforts should focus on improving health workers' data management skills and creating a culture of data use.\n\n**Tools and Processes:**\n- Advancements in information technology have led to the development of various tools to enhance data quality and use.\n- Integrated systems that meet the immunization program's needs are crucial for efficient data management.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile there is ample immunization and VPD surveillance data available globally, it is not being used optimally to inform public health actions due to access issues, quality concerns, and a lack of a strong data use culture. Strengthening data-related skills, enhancing data use through triangulation, and focusing on continuous quality improvement will be key to improving immunization program performance.\n\n**Acknowledgments:** The report acknowledges contributions from various health organizations and experts involved in immunization data quality and use.\n\n**Funding:** Supported by WHO and its donors for immunization data quality and use.]]",

The FDA has approved AI applications for clinical care.\n\n2. **Ownership and Control**: Many AI technologies are controlled by private entities, raising concerns about the access, use, and control of patient data. Public-private partnerships have sometimes failed to protect privacy adequately, highlighting the need for systemic oversight.\n\n3. **Privacy Breaches**: There is an increased risk of privacy breaches due to advanced algorithms that can potentially re-identify anonymized patient data. Studies indicate that sophisticated computational methods can identify individuals in datasets that have been scrubbed of identifiers.\n\n4. **Public Trust**: A survey revealed that only 11% of Americans are willing to share health data with tech companies, compared to 72% willing to share with physicians. This indicates a significant lack of trust in tech companies regarding data security.\n\n5. **Regulatory Challenges**: Current regulations are lagging behind technological advancements, necessitating a focus on patient agency, consent, and improved data anonymization methods. The regulatory landscape varies globally, with the U.S. and Canada lacking comprehensive frameworks specific to AI.\n\n6. **Recommendations**: The article suggests that regulations should foster patient agency and consent, ensure data remains within its jurisdiction, and encourage the use of generative data to mitigate privacy concerns. \n\n7. **Conclusion**: While AI has the potential to improve healthcare significantly, the challenges surrounding privacy and data protection are substantial and require urgent attention to safeguard patient information in the evolving landscape of healthcare technology.\n\nOverall, the article emphasizes the pressing need for robust privacy protections and regulatory frameworks to keep pace with the rapid development of AI in healthcare.]]",
