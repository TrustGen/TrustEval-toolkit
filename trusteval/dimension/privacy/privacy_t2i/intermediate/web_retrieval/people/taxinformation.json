This legislative action was spurred by a recent incident involving an IRS contractor, Charles Littlejohn, who leaked thousands of tax returns of wealthy individuals, including former President Donald Trump. The new bill, which was supported almost unanimously by the House Ways and Means Committee, proposes to raise the maximum prison sentence and fines for violators. However, the bill's progress in the Senate remains uncertain. Littlejohn was charged with unauthorized disclosure and received a maximum sentence of five years in prison.]]",

Soled, J.D.  \n**Publication Date:** October 2020 (snapshot from 2024/10/20)  \n**Related Topics:** Technology, Information Security & Privacy, Tax, IRS Practice & Procedure\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Prevalence of Data Breaches and Identity Theft:**\n   - Data breaches are common, with 4.1 billion private records exposed in the first half of 2019.\n   - A significant identity theft scheme affected veterans, costing them millions.\n\n2. **Financial Impact:**\n   - Data breaches cost U.S. companies an average of $8.19 million each.\n   - Global cybersecurity spending from 2017 to 2021 is expected to exceed $1 trillion.\n\n3. **Tax Deduction Issues:**\n   - Business losses from data breaches can be deducted under Section 165(a) or Section 162(a).\n   - Individual taxpayers face restrictions under Section 165(c), allowing deductions only for losses related to federally declared disasters, which does not typically include data breaches or identity theft.\n\n4. **Example of Tax Treatment:**\n   - If a taxpayer suffers a loss due to identity theft of securities, the loss may not be deductible under current law.\n   - Businesses can deduct cybersecurity expenses as ordinary and necessary expenses.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Businesses can deduct expenditures for cybersecurity measures.\n   - Individual taxpayers cannot currently deduct expenses related to protecting against data breaches due to changes in tax law (TCJA).\n\n6. **Income-Related Issues:**\n   - Reimbursements for losses due to breaches are generally taxable unless they are classified as a recovery of capital.\n   - In-kind benefits (e.g., credit monitoring services) provided by companies after a data breach are not considered taxable income according to IRS announcements.\n\n7. **IRS Guidance:**\n   - The IRS will not assert that individuals must include the value of identity protection services in their gross income, regardless of when they are provided.\n   - This guidance lacks statutory support and may be politically motivated to avoid backlash.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - While some IRS provisions offer relief for taxpayers affected by data breaches and identity theft, comprehensive tax relief remains limited.\n   - Future amendments to tax laws may be necessary for more substantial relief.\n\n**Authors' Background:**\n- Patrick M. Ryle is an assistant professor at Dalton State College, Georgia.\n- Leonard Goodman and Jay A. Soled are tax professors at Rutgers Business School, New Jersey.\n\n**Contact Information for Comments:**\n- Paul Bonner, JofA senior editor, email: Paul.Bonner@aicpa-cima.com, phone: 919-402-4434.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n- AICPA offers various resources and tools related to cybersecurity and data breaches.]]",

Driveline Retail Merch., Inc., where sensitive tax information of employees was allegedly disclosed due to a phishing attack. The court ruled that the plaintiff failed to meet the commonality requirement under Rule 23(a) because issues of causation and injury required individual inquiries. The court also found that certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief was inappropriate, as enhanced security measures would not remedy the harm already caused by the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). Additionally, certification under Rule 23(b)(3) was denied because the plaintiff could not demonstrate that all class members suffered compensable injuries, as many claims were based on speculative future harm. The court expressed doubts about whether the employer had a legal duty to protect employee PII beyond providing notice of the breach. This case highlights the challenges in certifying class actions related to data breaches and the ongoing complexities in data privacy litigation.]]\n\nKey Information Extracted:\n- Case Name: McGlenn v.
