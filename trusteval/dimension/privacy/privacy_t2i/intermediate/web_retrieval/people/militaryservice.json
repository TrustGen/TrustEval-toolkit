These tactics include sending malware-laden emails to Ukrainian military personnel and using disinformation to compile lists for potential harm. U.S. military service members and veterans are increasingly seen as high-value targets in the information war, with Russian disinformation efforts extending to American veterans through fake social media accounts.\n\nKey issues include:\n- The risk of personal data being exploited for misinformation and propaganda, particularly through data collected for targeted advertising.\n- The identification of service members via publicly available information and ad identifiers, which can reveal sensitive patterns of life and political preferences.\n- A specific case where a service member was falsely identified as \"patient zero\" for COVID-19, leading to online harassment.\n\nThe article emphasizes the need for legislative action to enhance data security and privacy for service members, including:\n1. Congress should pass federal data security and privacy legislation to protect military data.\n2. The military should educate personnel on social media risks and data collection practices, particularly regarding platforms like TikTok.\n3. The Department of Defense (DoD) must prioritize privacy as a national security issue, developing secure communication technologies to reduce reliance on commercial products.\n\nThe authors, Jessica Dawson and Brandon Pugh, advocate for immediate action to safeguard service members and their families, arguing that the threats in the information warfare landscape will continue to grow. Dawson is the division chief at the Army Cyber Institute, and Pugh is a senior fellow at the R Street Institute\u2019s Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats team.]]",
