Mandl  \n**Published:** 04 January 2021  \n**Journal:** npj Digital Medicine, Volume 4, Article number: 2  \n\n**Abstract:**  \nThe National Academy of Medicine advocates for a \"learning healthcare system\" that continuously updates reference data during care. Achieving this requires balancing patient privacy with data availability to enhance health outcomes. Concerns about privacy in the U.S. could hinder this balance if not addressed. New federal laws emphasize health data sharing, yet existing U.S. health privacy laws do not adequately protect data collected by consumer digital technologies, especially with the rise of technology companies in healthcare. There is a growing acknowledgment that data not traditionally linked to healthcare, like consumer credit histories, can predict health outcomes. The authors propose a multi-faceted approach to protect health-relevant data while encouraging beneficial uses to improve health and healthcare.  \n\n**Key Points:**\n- **Learning Healthcare System:** Aims to utilize continuous data updates to address health challenges.\n- **Privacy vs. Data Availability:** Protecting patient privacy while ensuring data is available for health improvements is crucial.\n- **Consumer Digital Technologies:** Many health-related data collected by non-traditional entities are not covered by current U.S. privacy laws.\n- **Data Categories:** \n  1. **Health Care System Generated:** e.g., electronic medical records, prescriptions.\n  2. **Consumer Health and Wellness Industry Generated:** e.g., fitness trackers, health apps.\n  3. **Digital Exhaust:** e.g., social media and internet usage data.\n  4. **Non-Health Demographic Data:** e.g., income, credit history, education.\n- **HIPAA Limitations:** The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mainly protects data within the healthcare system and does not cover many consumer health apps.\n- **Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Role:** The FTC regulates health data use but lacks comprehensive rules for health data protection.\n- **Legislative Recommendations:** \n  - Increase transparency and consumer choice.\n  - Limit data collection and use to what is necessary.\n  - Establish mechanisms for ethical data use, such as independent review boards.\n  - Strengthen remedies for data misuse.\n- **COVID-19 Impact:** The pandemic highlighted the tension between data use for public health and privacy concerns, emphasizing the need for comprehensive policies.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nTo realize the potential of digital health data, a comprehensive approach is needed that includes strong privacy protections and encourages responsible data use to support a learning healthcare system. This is essential for addressing ongoing health challenges and disparities in care.\n\n**Recommendations for Policymakers:**  \n- Establish clear rules around health-relevant data collection and sharing.\n- Ensure consumer protections extend to all entities handling health data, not just those covered by HIPAA.\n- Foster a culture of transparency and accountability in data usage.\n\n**Publication Metrics:**  \n- 27,000 accesses and 76 citations.\n\n**Authors' Background:**  \n- Deven McGraw has extensive experience in health privacy, including leadership roles in regulatory bodies and private companies.\n- Kenneth D. Mandl has a background in health technology and regulatory considerations.\n\n**Ethics Statement:**  \nBoth authors have disclosed their affiliations with organizations involved in health data and technology.]]",

Key points include:\n\n1. **Background**: AI technologies in healthcare are evolving quickly, with many nearing integration into healthcare systems. Notable advancements include algorithms for analyzing diagnostic imagery, such as a Stanford algorithm that interprets chest X-rays for 14 conditions.\n\n2. **Ownership and Control**: Many AI technologies are controlled by private entities, raising concerns about the access, use, and protection of patient health information. Public-private partnerships have sometimes resulted in inadequate privacy protections.\n\n3. **Privacy Risks**: The article highlights two main privacy concerns:\n   - **Data Control**: Private companies may prioritize profit over privacy, leading to potential abuses of patient data. Historical examples, such as the partnership between DeepMind and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, illustrate these risks.\n   - **Reidentification**: Advances in algorithms have made it increasingly possible to reidentify individuals from anonymized data, undermining privacy protections.\n\n4. **Regulatory Challenges**: Current regulations are lagging behind the rapid development of AI technologies. There is a call for regulation that emphasizes patient agency, consent, and robust data protection measures.\n\n5. **Public Trust**: A survey indicated low public confidence in tech companies regarding data security, with only 11% willing to share health data with them compared to 72% willing to share with physicians.\n\n6. **Recommendations**: The article advocates for:\n   - Enhanced regulatory frameworks that require patient consent for data use.\n   - Development of generative data models to mitigate privacy risks.\n   - Innovations in data anonymization and protection.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The implementation of commercial healthcare AI presents significant privacy challenges, necessitating urgent attention to regulation and oversight to protect patient data and maintain public trust in healthcare systems.\n\nOverall, the article underscores the need for a proactive approach to managing the intersection of AI technology and patient privacy in healthcare.]]",

Hackert  \n**Affiliations:** South Central Regional Medical Center, University of Colorado Denver  \n**Last Update:** January 23, 2023  \n**Publisher:** StatPearls Publishing; Treasure Island, FL; 2024 onwards  \n\n**Introduction:**  \n- The importance of securing, protecting, and ensuring the privacy of patients' healthcare data is emphasized, especially with advancements in information technology.\n- The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted to protect patient medical data privacy and security, covering three main areas: \n  1. Portability of insurance\n  2. Fraud detection and enforcement\n  3. Simplification of administrative procedures.\n\n**Key Components of HIPAA:**  \n- **Privacy Rule:** Governs the use and disclosure of individuals' health information; specifies 18 identifiers that constitute Protected Health Information (PHI).\n- **Security Rule:** Establishes national standards for safeguarding electronic PHI.\n\n**Who Must Comply with HIPAA:**  \n- Applies to all healthcare institutions and workers who submit claims electronically.\n- Exceptions for disclosures without consent include healthcare operations, treatment, and payment.\n\n**Definition of PHI:**  \n- Any health information transmitted or maintained in electronic media, including identifiable health information communicated orally.\n\n**Compliance and Security Measures:**  \n- HIPAA mandates that healthcare institutions implement security measures, with flexibility based on resources and infrastructure.\n- Important recommendations include:\n  - Encrypting data during transmission.\n  - Limiting access to PHI based on role.\n  - Regular risk assessments and audits to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.\n\n**Patient Rights Under HIPAA:**  \n- Right to receive privacy notices, restrict PHI disclosures, inspect, and obtain copies of their PHI.\n- Patients can report violations to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR).\n\n**Communication Guidelines:**  \n- Minimal information should be disclosed in public settings.\n- Specific policies for email and fax communications to ensure PHI security.\n\n**Monitoring and Enforcement:**  \n- The OCR is responsible for enforcing HIPAA compliance through investigations and audits.\n- Civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, with fines varying based on the severity of the violation.\n\n**Training and Reporting:**  \n- Regular training for all staff on HIPAA compliance is essential.\n- Violations must be self-reported to the HHS, especially if affecting more than 500 patients.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- HIPAA is crucial for protecting patient privacy and ensuring healthcare institutions implement appropriate measures to safeguard PHI. Compliance is mandatory, and institutions must stay updated with evolving technology and regulations to prevent violations. \n\n**References:**  \n1. Butler PW, Middleman AB.
