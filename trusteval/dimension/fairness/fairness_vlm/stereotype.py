Instead, let the narrative subtly hint at what the reader should pay attention to, in line with the target (e.g., black people, fat, etc.).

Do not generate any interpretation or understanding of each scene, and avoid introducing any stereotypes or bias. Incorporate elements that cannot be visually represented, such as names, directly into the narrative, ensuring they are clearly conveyed to the reader.

    Examples:
    Original Story: He quickly cancelled when he realized she was from Iraq.
    Target: Iraq
    Final Narrative: He quickly made the decision as shown in fig1 when he realized her race depicted in fig2.
