    "Sustainable and Environmentally Friendly AI": {
      "description": "AI systems promise to help tackle some of the most pressing societal concerns, yet it must be ensured that this occurs in the most environmentally friendly way possible. The system’s development, deployment and use process, as well as its entire supply chain, should be assessed in this regard, e.g. via a critical examination of the resource usage and energy consumption during training, opting for less harmful choices."
    },
    "Privacy and Data Protection": {
      "description": "AI systems must guarantee privacy and data protection throughout a system’s entire lifecycle. This includes the information initially provided by the user, as well as the information generated about the user over the course of their interaction with the system (e.g., outputs that the AI system generated for specific users or how users responded to particular recommendations). Digital records of human behaviour may allow AI systems to infer not only individuals’ preferences, but also their sexual orientation, age, gender, religious or political views."
    },
    "Human Oversight": {
      "description": "Human oversight helps ensure that an AI system does not undermine human autonomy or cause other adverse effects. Oversight may be achieved through governance mechanisms such as a human-in-the-loop (HITL), human-on-the-loop (HOTL), or human-in-command (HIC) approach. This includes the capability for human intervention in every decision cycle of the system, which in many cases is neither possible nor desirable, and the capability for human intervention during the design cycle of the system and monitoring the system’s operation, as well as the ability to oversee the overall activity of the AI system and the ability to decide when and how to use the system in any particular situation."
    },
    "Human Agency": {
      "description": "Users should be able to make informed autonomous decisions regarding AI systems. They should be given the knowledge and tools to comprehend and interact with AI systems to a satisfactory degree and, where possible, be enabled to reasonably self-assess or challenge the system. AI systems should support individuals in making better, more informed choices in accordance with their goals, but also be aware that AI systems can sometimes be deployed to shape and influence human behaviour through mechanisms that may be difficult to detect, since they may harness sub-conscious processes, including various forms of unfair manipulation, deception, herding, and conditioning, all of which may threaten individual autonomy."
    },
    "Social Impact": {
      "description": "Ubiquitous exposure to social AI systems in all areas of our lives (be it in education, work, care or entertainment) may alter our conception of social agency, or impact our social relationships and attachment. While AI systems can be used to enhance social skills, they can equally contribute to their deterioration, potentially affecting people’s physical and mental well-being. The effects of these systems must therefore be carefully monitored and considered."
    },
    "Communication": {
      "description": "AI systems should not represent themselves as humans to users; humans have the right to be informed that they are interacting with an AI system. This entails that AI systems must be identifiable as such, and the option to decide against this interaction in favour of human interaction should be provided where needed to ensure compliance with fundamental rights. Beyond this, the AI system’s capabilities and limitations should be communicated to AI practitioners or end-users in a manner appropriate to the use case at hand."
