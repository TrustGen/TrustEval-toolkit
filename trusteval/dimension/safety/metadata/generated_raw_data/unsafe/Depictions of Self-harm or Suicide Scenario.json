        "summary": "[[Summary: \nThe article titled \"Self-harm and suicidal behaviors in children: perspectives of mental health clinicians\" by Michelle L. Townsend et al., published in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology, explores the increasing presentations of self-harm and suicidal behaviors among children aged 12 and under. The study involves interviews with 26 mental health clinicians from the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia, aiming to understand how these professionals conceptualize, identify, and respond to such behaviors in young children.\n\nKey Findings:\n1. **Increased Presentations**: There is a rising trend in self-harm and suicidal behaviors in children, with clinicians noting that these behaviors present differently in younger children compared to adolescents. Specific methods of self-harm, such as head banging and hair pulling, are more common in children.\n\n2. **Risk Factors**: Clinicians identified multiple risk factors, including low socioeconomic status, parental mental health issues, trauma, and familial history of suicide. The presence of mental health issues in parents and exposure to suicide-related discussions at home were particularly noted as significant contributors.\n\n3. **Developmentally Appropriate Screening**: Effective screening for self-harm and suicidal behaviors requires using language suitable for the child\u2019s age and involving parents in the assessment process. Clinicians emphasized the importance of normalizing discussions about these topics to make children feel comfortable.\n\n4. **Parental Involvement**: Including parents in the treatment process is crucial, as they can help manage their child\u2019s behaviors and emotions. Clinicians expressed the need for resources and support for parents to understand and cope with their child\u2019s self-harm and suicidal behaviors.\n\n5. **School Collaboration**: Clinicians highlighted the importance of collaborating with schools to support affected children. However, they noted that primary school staff often lack training in handling self-harm and suicidal behaviors, which can hinder effective intervention.\n\n6. **Service Gaps**: The study identified significant gaps in mental health services for children under 12, including limited availability of emergency care and long wait times for mental health services. Clinicians reported challenges in finding appropriate referrals for children with self-harm or suicidal behaviors.\n\n7. **Implications for Policy and Practice**: The findings suggest a need for improved screening, assessment, and treatment protocols tailored for younger children. There is also a call for increased training for school staff and better resources for parents.\n\nThe study underscores the urgent need for timely and effective interventions that involve clinicians, parents, and schools to address self-harm and suicidal behaviors in children, emphasizing that understanding these behaviors is critical for effective treatment and support.]]",

The review encompasses 49 studies published up to April 2020, focusing on the daily risk factors associated with suicide and self-harm.\n\n### Key Findings\n1. **Daily Affect and Suicidality**: \n   - Increased negative affect (NA) and decreased positive affect (PA) are consistently linked to suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviors.\n   - Daily fluctuations in affect, rumination, and interpersonal interactions serve as predictors for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).\n\n2. **Methodological Insights**:\n   - Most studies utilized signal-based sampling strategies, averaging six assessments per day.\n   - The studies predominantly involved participants diagnosed with mental disorders, particularly Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and major depressive disorder (MDD).\n\n3. **Risk Factors Identified**:\n   - Key risk factors include:\n     - Past suicide attempts\n     - Emotional instability\n     - Negative social interactions\n     - Low social support\n     - Sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, nightmares)\n\n4. **Sample Characteristics**:\n   - Majority of studies were conducted in the United States (30 studies), with others from the UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, Belgium, China, and Ireland.\n   - Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 53.7 years, with a significant proportion being female (75.7%).\n\n5. **Psychological Factors**:\n   - Various psychological traits such as impulsivity, hopelessness, and emotional dysregulation were associated with increased risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation.\n   - Daily assessments revealed that individuals with a history of NSSI exhibited heightened emotional instability.\n\n6. **Gaps in Research**:\n   - There is a lack of standardized reporting and methodological quality across studies, which hampers the ability to conduct a meta-analysis.\n   - Limited exploration of daily sleep and social interaction patterns in relation to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.\n\n### Conclusions\nThe review suggests that EMA is a valuable tool for understanding the daily dynamics of suicidality and self-harm. It highlights the need for further research to standardize methodologies and explore the role of social and sleep factors in suicide prevention. Future studies should leverage machine learning techniques to analyze the complex data generated by EMA.\n\n### Limitations\n- Heterogeneity in study designs and participant characteristics limits the synthesis of findings.\n- Many studies lacked adequate reporting on data quality and analysis methods.\n- Exclusion of non-English studies may have omitted relevant research.\n\n### Future Directions\n- Emphasis on longitudinal designs and the integration of EMA with machine learning to enhance predictive capabilities for suicidal behaviors.\n- Development of standardized measures for EMA studies to improve comparability and reliability of findings.\n\n]]",

McMahon, Laura Hemming, Jo Robinson, Eve Griffin\n- Journal: Front Psychiatry\n- Published: January 10, 2023\n- DOI: 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1120396\n- PMCID: PMC9872102\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Prevalence and Risk Factors:**\n   - Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth globally.\n   - Approximately 10% of young people engage in self-harm.\n   - A meta-analysis by Xiao et al. found a 23.2% prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents.\n   - Higher rates of NSSI reported in specific populations, such as 30.7% in an Israeli study and 33.9% among Chinese adolescents.\n   - Risk factors include childhood trauma, psychological symptoms, bullying, and substance use.\n\n2. **Service Utilization:**\n   - Many youths do not seek help after self-harming; stigma is a significant barrier.\n   - A study found that 24% of CAMHS referrals in Scotland were for suicidality.\n   - Only 25% of young people who died by suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year.\n\n3. **Methodologies:**\n   - The document discusses various methodologies, including qualitative studies and the use of Experience Sampling Methods (ESM).\n   - Studies highlighted the importance of biological markers and polygenic risk scores for predicting suicide risk.\n\n4. **Young People\u2019s Experiences:**\n   - Qualitative studies reveal that young people often view suicidal thoughts as part of everyday life and use self-harm as a coping mechanism.\n   - Themes from interviews include social disconnection, bullying, and the influence of peer groups.\n\n5. **Global Trends:**\n   - The document emphasizes the rising mental health issues among young people worldwide, particularly in low-middle-income countries (LMICs).\n   - Future research should focus on the experiences of those with lived experiences, caregivers, and intervention studies.\n\n6. **Funding and Acknowledgments:**\n   - Authors received funding from various health research organizations.\n   - The research was conducted without any commercial conflicts of interest.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe research highlights the urgent need for better understanding and intervention strategies for youth experiencing suicidal behavior and self-harm. The studies underscore the importance of addressing barriers to help-seeking and the necessity of targeted mental health services for young people.]]",
