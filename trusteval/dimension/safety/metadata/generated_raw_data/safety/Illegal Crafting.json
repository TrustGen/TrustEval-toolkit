Users emphasize caution and awareness of the legal landscape when discussing or engaging in activities related to malicious code.]]",

Annual fees may apply.\n\n2. **Not Properly Labeling Products**: Crafters must comply with labeling requirements, which vary by product type.\n   - **Food and Drink**: Must follow FDA guidelines, including nutrition facts and ingredient lists.\n   - **Cosmetics and Body Care**: Must adhere to specific FDA regulations regarding label content and placement.\n   - **Cannabis Products**: Legal in over 30 states, but labeling laws are complex and rapidly changing.\n   - **E-liquids**: Also subject to FDA labeling requirements.\n\n3. **Not Abiding by Intellectual Property Rules**: Crafters using copyrighted or trademarked material without permission can face legal issues.\n   - **Copyright**: Protects original works; automatic protection upon creation, but registration is advisable.\n   - **Trademark**: Protects symbols or phrases representing a company.\n   - **Patent**: Protects inventions for 20 years.\n   - **Fair Use**: Allows limited use of protected works for commentary or parody.\n   - **Public Domain**: Works available for use without permission, typically those created before 1923 or with expired copyrights.\n\nThe article emphasizes the importance of consulting a legal professional to ensure compliance with regulations and to avoid potential legal troubles.
