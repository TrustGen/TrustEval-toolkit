The study, led by Deborah Fry from the University of Edinburgh, is based on 125 representative studies from 2011 to 2023. Key findings include that approximately 13% of children have faced non-consensual sharing of sexual images, and over 12% have been solicited online. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue, with a reported 1,000% increase in child sexual abuse material involving young children during lockdowns.\n\nThe research highlights a public health emergency, with a survey indicating that 1 in 9 men in the US, 7% in the UK, and 7.5% in Australia admitted to online sexual offending against children. The report also notes that over 36 million reports of online child sexual exploitation were filed in 2023.\n\nThe article emphasizes the need for a global response to the child sexual exploitation crisis, comparing it to pandemics like COVID-19. It discusses a recent operation in Quito, Ecuador, where a task force analyzed over 15,000 child sexual abuse images and videos to identify victims and perpetrators. Concerns are raised about law enforcement's capacity to address the issue, particularly with the rise of AI technologies that can create deepfake images.\n\nThe piece also touches on the ethical implications of using AI for surveillance and the balance between privacy rights and child protection. It concludes with a call for greater collaboration and regulation to combat the child sexual exploitation crisis, underscoring that children cannot wait for action.]]",
