        "summary": "[[Summary: \nThe article \"The Rise of Political Violence in the United States\" by Rachel Kleinfeld, published in October 2021 in the Journal of Democracy, discusses the increasing political violence in the U.S., particularly following the 2020 presidential election. Key points include:\n\n1. **Triggers of Violence**: Political violence can be triggered by social events or intentionally incited for partisan purposes. A notable incident involved Eric Coomer, an executive at Dominion Voting Systems, who faced threats and went into hiding after false accusations of election fraud.\n\n2. **Threats to Election Officials**: In 2020, a significant number of election officials received threats, with one-third of poll workers feeling unsafe. The Department of Justice established a task force to address these threats.\n\n3. **Nature of Political Violence**: The landscape of political violence has shifted from organized groups to individuals self-radicalizing online. Most incidents are committed by individuals unaffiliated with formal organizations, highlighting a trend of \"ungrouping.\"\n\n4. **Historical Context**: Political violence in the U.S. has evolved from leftist groups in the late 1960s to a predominance of right-wing violence today. The far-right violence is often planned and perpetrated by individuals who are otherwise integrated into society.\n\n5. **Demographic Factors**: White Christian evangelical Republicans and individuals feeling threatened by women or minorities are more likely to support political violence. Surveys indicate a significant percentage of Republicans believe in the necessity of using force to protect their way of life.\n\n6. **Election Violence Risk Factors**: Four global risk factors for election-related violence are identified: competitive elections, identity-based partisan divisions, electoral rules exploiting identity cleavages, and weak institutional constraints on violence.\n\n7. **Comparative Analysis**: The article compares U.S. trends with historical instances of electoral violence in other countries, particularly highlighting the role of political manipulation in inciting violence.\n\n8. **Proposed Solutions**: Kleinfeld suggests five areas for intervention to mitigate political violence: enhancing election credibility, reforming electoral rules, improving policing, prevention and redirection strategies, and promoting responsible political speech.\n\n9. **Current Political Climate**: The political environment in the U.S. is characterized by increasing polarization, with both Democrats and Republicans showing rising levels of support for political violence, although right-wing violence remains more prevalent.\n\n10. **Conclusion**: The article emphasizes the urgent need to address the underlying causes of political violence to prevent a downward spiral into more severe conflict in the future. \n\nThe article provides a comprehensive overview of the factors contributing to political violence in the U.S. and offers insights into potential pathways for reducing this threat.]]",

Immediate action is necessary to mitigate these risks and safeguard democratic institutions.]]",

A Reuters/Ipsos poll indicated that about 20% of voters from both parties found political violence acceptable to achieve their vision of a better society.\n- The rise in violence has led to increased security measures in local election offices and warnings from the Department of Homeland Security regarding threats from political extremists.\n- The report also details the profile of Austin Combs, who had a troubled past marked by violence and mental health issues, and his interactions with the local community, which heavily leans Republican.\n- Other notable incidents include the 2022 shooting of ten Black shoppers in Buffalo by a white supremacist and the attempted murder of Louisville\u2019s Democratic mayoral candidate by a left-wing activist.\n- The report underscores the lack of a standardized definition of political violence, complicating efforts to track and address it effectively.\n\nThe report concludes with a grim perspective on the future, suggesting that the current political climate may lead to more incidents of violence, as communities become increasingly polarized and hostile towards opposing political views.]]",
