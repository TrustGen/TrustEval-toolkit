Martha McSally and Rep. Adam Schiff.\n   - The ACLU argues against new laws, stating existing laws suffice and that new legislation could worsen criminalization of marginalized communities.\n\n**Sources Cited:**\n- FBI, Department of Homeland Security, Global Terrorism Database, Congressional Research Service, New America, and various interviews.\n\n**Contradictory Information:**\n- While some sources indicate an increase in terrorism, others caution against labeling all incidents as domestic terrorism, highlighting the complexity of definitions and motivations involved. \n\nThis summary encapsulates the key facts and trends regarding terrorism in the U.S. as of the article's publication date, providing a comprehensive overview of the topic.]]\n\n",

What do terrorists want?  \n**Author:** Frederic Lemieux, Professor at Georgetown University  \n**Published Date:** May 23, 2017  \n**Last Updated:** June 2, 2017  \n\n**Key Events:**\n- On May 23, 2017, an attack at the Manchester Arena claimed at least 22 lives and injured 59 others, with one victim being just eight years old. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for this attack. The Mayor of Manchester described it as \u201can evil act.\u201d\n\n**Definitions and Concepts:**\n1. **Terrorism:**\n   - Defined as a tactic rather than an ideology.\n   - Used in asymmetric power struggles, typically by weaker groups against powerful nation-states.\n   - Aims to instill fear in the targeted population and provoke violent responses from the state.\n   - The cycle of violence can be difficult to disrupt.\n   - Recent trends show terrorist groups utilizing the internet and media for recruitment and spreading fear.\n\n2. **Objectives of Terrorists:**\n   - Vary widely; often justified by perceived social, economic, or political injustices.\n   - Motivations can stem from religious beliefs, ethnic separatism, or socioeconomic doctrines.\n   - Examples include:\n     - Irish Republican Army (ethnic separatism)\n     - Al-Qaida and IS (religious crusade)\n     - FARC (socioeconomic, communist beliefs)\n     - Medellin Cartel (narco-terrorism)\n\n3. **Trends in Terrorism:**\n   - Contrary to public perception, terrorism is not more frequent today than in previous decades.\n   - Terrorist activity peaked during the 1970s, particularly during the Cold War.\n   - From 2000 to 2016, the U.K. and Western Europe experienced relatively low terrorist activity compared to 1970-1995.\n   - In the U.S., terrorist incidents declined significantly from 475 per year in 1970 to fewer than 20 by 2011.\n   - Most terrorist attacks globally are concentrated in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria, which accounted for 78% of deaths and 57% of attacks in 2014.\n   - Only 3% of deaths from terrorist attacks since 2000 occurred in Western countries, with the U.S. accounting for 2.2% of the global total.\n\n**Statistics:**\n- 30% of terrorist violence in Western countries is attributed to organized groups like al-Qaida and IS; 70% to \"lone wolves.\"\n- According to Audrey Cronin, a study of 457 terrorist groups since 1968 shows that they last an average of eight years, with 94% failing to achieve their strategic goals.\n\n**Corrections:**\n- The article was updated to correct a previous inaccurate description of PETA (People for Ethical Treatment of Animals).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The article emphasizes the complexity of terrorism, the motivations behind it, and the actual trends in terrorist activity, which may differ from popular perceptions.]]",

Notable attacks include those on hotels in Mali and Burkina Faso. Groups like the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara are active due to weak governance and climate change.\n- **Myanmar:** Terrorism deaths increased from fewer than 40 (2015-2018) to over 800 (2018-2022) following the military coup in February 2021.\n- **Latin America:** Terrorism cases have declined since the 1990s but still pose challenges, particularly from dissident groups in Colombia.\n\n**Trends and Observations:**\n- Since 2015, global terrorism has generally become less deadly, with average deaths per attack decreasing from three in 2015 to fewer than two in 2021.\n- However, there are signs of increasing deadliness in terrorist attacks from 2021 to 2022, with fatalities concentrated in fewer countries.\n- The IEP Global Terrorism Index indicates a decline in countries experiencing terrorism-related deaths, from 33% in 2015 to 26% in 2022.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n- The global terrorism landscape is complex and evolving, with both positive trends (decreases in certain regions) and worrying trends (rising domestic terrorism in the U.S.).\n- Policymakers must continue to invest in security measures and adapt to new challenges, including advancements in technology like artificial intelligence.\n\n**Key Dates:**\n- 2001: 9/11 attacks\n- 2014: Peak of global terrorism incidents\n- 2015-2018: Low terrorism deaths in Myanmar\n- February 2021: Military coup in Myanmar leading to increased violence\n- 2022: Notable increase in concentration of terrorism-related deaths.\n\n**Contradictory Information:**\n- While terrorism peaked dramatically in 2014, the overall global trend since 2015 has shown a decline in the deadliness of attacks, indicating a complex and fluctuating situation.]]",
