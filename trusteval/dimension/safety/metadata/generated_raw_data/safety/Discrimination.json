A 2019 Glassdoor survey indicated that nearly 60% of U.S. workers experience some form of discrimination. The EEOC reported 61,331 workplace discrimination charges in 2021.\n\n**Types of Discrimination:**\n1. **Age Discrimination:**\n   - Defined by the EEOC as treating an employee less favorably due to age.\n   - Illegal for those over 40 under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).\n   - Examples include:\n     - Older applicants passed over for promotions.\n     - Forced early retirements based on age.\n     - Age preferences in job postings.\n\n2. **Gender Discrimination:**\n   - Involves differential treatment based on gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\n   - 42% of working women in the U.S. report experiencing it.\n   - Examples include:\n     - Unwelcome sexual advances.\n     - Unequal pay for the same work.\n     - Pregnancy discrimination in promotions.\n\n3. **Racial Discrimination:**\n   - Involves harassment or unfair treatment based on race or ethnicity.\n   - Governed by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n   - Examples include:\n     - Racially motivated jokes or assumptions.\n     - Unequal pay or job assignments based on race.\n\n4. **Disability Discrimination:**\n   - Unequal treatment based on disability status, often overlooked.\n   - Prohibited under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n   - Examples include:\n     - Job offers rescinded due to disability.\n     - Lack of reasonable accommodations for disabled employees.\n\n**Retaliation:**\n- Punishment for reporting discrimination is also considered discrimination, with the EEOC noting it as a common claim.\n\n**Examples of Illegal Discrimination:**\n1.

Employees of different races receive unequal pay for similar roles.\n4. Taylor experiences harassment based on their gender identity.\n5. Maria is fired due to age-related assumptions.\n6. Micah encounters workplace accessibility issues related to her disability.\n\n**Ways to Prevent Discrimination:**\n1. **Inclusive Job Descriptions:** Use neutral language to avoid bias.\n2. **Anonymous Hiring:** Remove identifying information from applications.\n3. **Culture Fit vs. Culture Add:** Focus on skills and diverse viewpoints rather than personal chemistry.\n4. **Ensure Accessibility:** Physical and digital accessibility must be prioritized.\n5. **Invest in Management Training:** Provide DEI training to all employees, especially leaders.\n6. **Team-Building Activities:** Foster collaboration and trust among diverse teams.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nUnderstanding and addressing workplace discrimination is crucial for creating a fair and inclusive environment. Employers can take proactive steps to minimize discrimination through training, policy changes, and fostering an inclusive culture.]]\n\n",
