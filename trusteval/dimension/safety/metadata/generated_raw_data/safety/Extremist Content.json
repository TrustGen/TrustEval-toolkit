This approach is one of the first to incorporate perspectives from both extremists and their families.\n  \n2. **Risk Factors for Radicalization:**\n   - Financial instability\n   - Mental health challenges\n   - Feelings of isolation and loneliness in communities or schools\n\n3. **Pathways Out of Extremism:**\n   - Disillusionment or burnout often prompted exits from extremist groups.\n   - Heavy-handed interventions by authorities can lead to increased extremism rather than deterrence.\n   - Exposure to diversity and acts of kindness from previously hated groups played a role in deradicalization.\n\n4. **Project Partners:** Collaborated with organizations such as Parents for Peace and Beyond Barriers, which focus on deradicalization and support for former extremists.\n\n**Related Research Insights:**\n- **Veterans and Extremism:** Studies show that U.S. veterans do not support extremist groups at a higher rate than the general population, despite being targeted for recruitment due to their skills.\n- **Online Behavior:** Violent extremists have adapted their strategies to exploit the internet, necessitating new countermeasures.\n- **National Strategy Needed:** A comprehensive U.S. strategy is essential to counter racially and ethnically motivated violent extremism (REMVE), which is largely leaderless and diffuse.\n\n**Funding and Acknowledgments:** The research was supported by the Ellen Hancock Impact Award for Social and Economic Well-Being and originally funded by the National Institute of Justice.\n\n**Research Team:** Key researchers include Ryan Andrew Brown, Todd C. Helmus, Rajeev Ramchand, and others.\n\n**Conclusion:** The RAND Corporation emphasizes the need for nuanced understanding and effective interventions to address the evolving threat of violent extremism in America.]]",
