Effective solutions must be multifaceted and address both immediate public safety needs and long-term community resilience.\n\n### Acknowledgments: \nThe authors express gratitude to various contributors for their guidance and support in the research and analysis process.\n\n### Related Resources: \n- Analysis of FBI Crime Statistics\n- Understanding the FBI\u2019s 2021 Crime Data\n\n]]",
