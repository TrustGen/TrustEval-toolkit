Examples, laws, and standards  \n**Author:** Josh Fruhlinger  \n**Published Date:** January 10, 2022  \n**Duration of Read:** 9 mins  \n\n**Definition of PII:**  \n- PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information, which is any data that can be used to identify an individual.  \n- The U.S. General Services Administration defines PII as information that can distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or in combination with other data.  \n- Non-PII can become PII when additional information is made publicly available that allows for individual identification.\n\n**Examples of PII:**  \nCommonly recognized PII includes:  \n- Name  \n- Address  \n- Email  \n- Telephone number  \n- Date of birth  \n- Government-issued ID numbers (e.g., passport, driver\u2019s license)  \n- Social Security number  \n- Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints)  \n- Credit/debit card numbers  \n\n**Contextual Understanding of PII:**  \n- PII is increasingly valuable, leading to concerns over its use by businesses and cybercriminals.  \n- The definition of PII evolves based on context and combinations of data points. For example, a mother\u2019s maiden name may not be PII alone, but it can become PII when combined with other identifiers.\n\n**High-Risk PII:**  \n- Defined by the Department of Energy as PII that, if compromised, could cause substantial harm or embarrassment to an individual.\n\n**Related Concept - PHI:**  \n- Protected Health Information (PHI) is a special category of PII protected under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, relating specifically to health data.\n\n**Legislation on PII:**  \n- U.S. lacks a single overarching data protection law, but HIPAA and various state laws (e.g., California Privacy Rights Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act) provide some protections.  \n- The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU, effective 2016, imposes strict rules on PII handling and grants rights to EU citizens, such as data deletion requests.\n\n**NIST PII Standards:**  \n- The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidelines for PII protection, which include various types of identifying information.\n\n**Protecting PII:**  \n- Organizations must identify, classify, and implement policies for PII management and security.  \n- Responsibilities for PII protection typically lie with the company controlling the data, often designated to specific roles (e.g., privacy officer, data protection officer).\n\n**Career Opportunities in PII Protection:**  \n- Certifications in data privacy are available for professionals, including:  \n  - Certified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer (CDPSE)  \n  - Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP)  \n  - Certified Information Privacy Technologist (CIPT)  \n  - Certified Information Privacy Manager (CIPM)  \n  - Certified Data Protection Officer (CDPO)  \n  - HealthCare Information Security and Privacy Practitioner (HCISPP)\n\nThis article outlines the importance of understanding PII, its implications for data privacy, and the legal frameworks surrounding it.]]",
