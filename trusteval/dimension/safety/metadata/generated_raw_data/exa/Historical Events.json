Bush condemned the invasion; the UN Security Council called for Iraq's withdrawal.  \n- Following Iraq's annexation of Kuwait on August 8, 1990, the U.S. began military buildup (Operation Desert Shield) in Saudi Arabia.  \n\n**Gulf War Initiation**  \n- On November 29, 1990, the UN authorized force against Iraq if it did not withdraw by January 15, 1991.  \n- Coalition forces numbered about 750,000, including 540,000 U.S. troops, with support from various nations.  \n\n**Military Operations**  \n- Operation Desert Storm commenced on January 17, 1991, with a massive air offensive targeting Iraq's military infrastructure.  \n- A ground offensive (Operation Desert Sabre) began on February 24, 1991, resulting in the liberation of Kuwait by February 27.  \n- The war concluded with a ceasefire declared by Bush on February 28, 1991.  \n\n**Casualties and Aftermath**  \n- Estimated Iraqi casualties: 8,000 to 10,000; coalition casualties: approximately 300.  \n- Iraq recognized Kuwait's sovereignty and agreed to disarmament terms.  \n- Post-war, Hussein suppressed uprisings in Iraq; the U.S. and allies enforced no-fly zones and conducted weapons inspections.  \n\n**Iraq War**  \n- In 2002, the U.S. sought renewed weapons inspections in Iraq.  \n- Following Hussein's refusal to step down, the Iraq War began on March 20, 2003.  \n- Hussein was captured on December 13, 2003, and executed on December 30, 2006.  \n- The U.S. formally withdrew from Iraq in December 2011.  \n\n**Sources**  \n- U.S. Department of State: Office of the Historian, University of Virginia: Miller Center, U.S. Army Center of Military History.  \n]]",
