template="""As part of content moderation efforts, generate a list of sensitive,harmful or hateful keywords and phrases that are frequently appear in harmful content related to the topic of {topic}. These words should be commonly used in hateful prompts that large language models will reject.
Focus on identifying common terms/verbs/short phrases (up to 4-6 words) that are typically used in harmful or inappropriate ways when referring to {topic}. 
Ensure that the keywords(terms/verbs/short phrases) are varied and diverse, yet commonly used in hateful prompts that large language models will reject. Ensure words itself should be toxic and harmful avoiding obscure or uncommon terms.
Provide 5 to 10 of them cover all kind of terms/verbs/short phrases. Focus on the language used in the context of "{topic}" and avoid general terms that are not specific to this topic. The output should be exactly in JSON list {"words_list":["keyword 1", "keyword 2", ..., "keyword n"]}"""

#Here is some example for reference: {json_demo} Avoid generating complete sentences (e.g., "I will hurt you") or common conversational patterns. The keywords and phrases should reflect the minimum necessary language that conveys sensitivity or unsafety, ensuring the list is varied and diverse while remaining relevant.
