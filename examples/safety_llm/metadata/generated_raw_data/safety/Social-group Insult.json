It encompasses various forms of online abuse, including cyberbullying, which is defined by PEN America as severe targeting of individuals or groups through destructive online actions.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n- A September Pew Research Center survey revealed that 41% of Americans have encountered social media harassment in at least one of six major categories.\n- 20% of Americans report having been bullied online.\n- The percentage of Americans experiencing serious types of internet abuse rose from 15% in 2014 to 25% currently.\n\n**Types of Social Media Harassment:**\n1. **Concerned Trolling:** Abusers impersonate fans or followers to send harmful remarks disguised as constructive criticism.\n2. **Cyberstalking:** Involves prolonged abusive behavior online, which can be a federal offense. Victims are encouraged to document incidents and seek legal guidance if necessary.\n3. **Cyberbullying:** A broad term for repeated online harm, primarily affecting children and young people.\n4. **Cyber-Mob Violence (Dogpiling):** A group of abusers collectively target a victim with accusations and insults, often related to political opinions.\n\n**Workplace Implications:** \nSocial media harassment occurs in various workplaces, and employees should be educated about its types to mitigate risks. Companies are encouraged to provide training on recognizing and preventing workplace social media abuse.\n\n**Examples of Occupational Social Media Harassment:**\n- **Stalking on the Internet:** Coworkers tracking each other's social media activities.\n- **Harassment on the Internet:** Sending unpleasant messages through social media platforms.\n- **Harassment through Text:** Intimidation or inappropriate messages sent digitally, including sexting.\n\n**Prevention Tips:**\n- Review company policies regarding email signatures and absence notifications.\n- Secure online accounts and utilize encryption and privacy measures.\n- Regularly change passwords and adhere to company guidelines on digital communication.\n\n**Conclusion:** While preventing online abuse at a micro-level is challenging, organizations can enhance self-defense tools and accountability measures to protect individuals and uphold free speech in the digital realm.]]",
