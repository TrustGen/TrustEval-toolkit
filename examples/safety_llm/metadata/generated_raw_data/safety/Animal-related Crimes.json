This can occur through direct actions (commission) or neglect (omission).\n   - It includes causing harm for specific purposes, such as entertainment, or as an end in itself, termed zoosadism.\n\n2. **Forms of Animal Cruelty**:\n   - **Industrial Animal Farming**: Concerns regarding the welfare of farm animals.\n   - **Fur Industry**: Issues surrounding the treatment of animals for fur production.\n   - **Psychological Links**: Allegations of connections between animal cruelty and human violence or psychological disorders.\n   - **Sexual Abuse**: Instances of sexual violence against animals.\n   - **Cultural Rituals**: Practices that may involve animal suffering.\n   - **Entertainment**: Various forms, including:\n     - Television and filmmaking\n     - Internet videos\n     - Circuses\n     - Animal fighting\n     - Rattlesnake round-ups\n   - **Warfare**: Use of animals in military contexts.\n   - **Scientific Experiments**: Unnecessary testing on animals.\n   - **Pet Policies**: Issues related to abandonment and no pet policies.\n   - **Hunting**: The practice of hunting animals.\n\n3. **Legal Framework**:\n   - Animal cruelty laws vary significantly across different countries and regions. \n   - In the U.S., practices like tail docking in pigs are common, while such procedures are banned in the European Union.\n\n4. **Philosophical Perspectives**:\n   - **Utilitarianism**: Advocates weigh the costs and benefits of animal treatment, leading to varied conclusions about acceptable practices.\n   - **Animal Rights Theory**: Critics argue for the inherent rights of animals, asserting that most animal use is unnecessary and causes suffering. They advocate for ending the property status of animals to ensure their protection.\n\n5. **Contradictions**:\n   - There are inconsistencies in definitions and practices of animal cruelty across different cultures and legal systems, such as the acceptance of tail docking in the U.S. versus its prohibition in the EU.\n\n6. **Further Reading and References**:\n   - The article includes references to various laws by country, discussions on animal welfare, and links to related ethical movements.\n\n]]",

Males are more involved in both types but are four times more likely to commit intentional cruelty.\n   - **Arrests**: Over one-third of intentional cruelty incidents result in arrest, compared to about one-quarter for neglect.\n\n3. **Research Significance**: This study is significant as it helps differentiate between types of animal abuse, which is crucial for developing targeted prevention and intervention strategies. \n\n4. **Statistical Data**: The study cites FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program data from 2017 and 2018, with a focus on data collection initiated in 2016 under the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).\n\n5. **Expert Commentary**: \n   - Dr. Mary Lou Randour (AWI) emphasizes the importance of studying cruelty incidents for intervention opportunities.\n   - Dr. Lynn Addington (American University) notes that previous research often combined both forms of cruelty, limiting policy development.\n\n6. **Call to Action**: The AWI urges law enforcement to take animal cruelty seriously and to systematically report incidents to federal authorities.\n\n7. **Media Contacts**:\n   - Marjorie Fishman, AWI: [email protected], (202) 446-2128\n   - Natasha Abel, American University: [email protected], (202) 885-5950\n\n8. **Organizations**: \n   - The Animal Welfare Institute, founded in 1951, aims to reduce animal suffering and improve treatment across various contexts.\n   - American University focuses on impactful scholarship and community engagement.]]",
