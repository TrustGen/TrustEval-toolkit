Enhance cybersecurity training for military personnel, focusing on real threats and tactics.\n2. Provide a list of DoD-approved cybersecurity tools for service members to use on personal devices.\n3. Supply antivirus protection for all military personnel\u2019s devices to mitigate risks.\n4. Recognize that human error is a significant vector for cyberattacks and address it through ongoing education and engagement.\n\n**Background Information**: \n- The Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy released strategies in late 2023 emphasizing the importance of the information environment.\n- The 2023 Annual Threat Assessment indicates a growing cyber threat from strategic competitors and nontraditional actors.\n\n**Contradictions**: \n- While the article notes the increasing sophistication of nonstate actors in cyber warfare, it also mentions that traditional military strategies may not fully account for these new tactics, suggesting a gap in military readiness.\n\n**Conclusion**: The article stresses the importance of addressing cyber vulnerabilities within the U.S. military to protect personnel and maintain operational integrity in a rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape.]]",
