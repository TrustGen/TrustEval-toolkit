This leads to disproportionate rates of arrest and incarceration.\n\n4. **Consequences of Implicit Bias**:\n   - Failure to address implicit biases contributes to systemic social injustices.\n   - Everyone has internalized some racist beliefs, making it essential to confront these biases for cultural change.\n\n5. **Becoming Anti-Racist**:\n   - Changing unjust social constructs requires conscious effort and practice.\n   - Acknowledging personal racist beliefs is the first step to growth and change.\n   - Individuals should actively seek objective facts that challenge their biases and reflect on their implicit beliefs.\n\n**Conclusion**: The article emphasizes the importance of recognizing and confronting implicit biases to foster a more just society. \n\n**Author's Background**: Sherry Benton is the founder and Chief Science Officer of TAO Connect and a professor emeritus at the University of Florida.\n\n**Related Topics**: Social justice, racism, bias, mental health.\n\n**Contradictions/Inconsistencies**: None explicitly noted in the text; however, the complexity of social constructs and biases may lead to varied interpretations based on individual experiences and societal changes.]]",

Early-life social interactions significantly shape the ability to manage stereotype tendencies.\n\n3. **Interaction Games**: Researchers use computer-mediated interaction games to study stereotypes without visual or auditory cues, allowing for controlled assessments of participants' behaviors based on preconceived beliefs about their partners.\n\n4. **Findings on Prefrontal Damage**: A study on patients with prefrontal lobe damage showed that these individuals did not adapt their behaviors when interacting with presumed child partners, highlighting the prefrontal lobe's role in responding to stereotypes.\n\n5. **Developmental Factors**: The research indicates that children's social environments, such as daycare attendance, influence their ability to adjust behaviors based on their interaction partners.

Fiske (Princeton University)\n\n**Published in:** Current Opinion in Psychology, December 2017\n\n**Abstract Summary:**\n- Social class (SC) stereotypes contribute to inequality through ambivalent content, early acquisition in children, academic consequences, institutionalization in education, and their prevalence in unequal societies.\n- Class stereotypes depict lower-SES individuals negatively (less competent, less human) while sometimes attributing warmth to them. Conversely, higher-SES individuals are seen as competent but cold.\n- Children as young as 4-6 years old can classify individuals by wealth and perceive wealth as a marker of competence, with stereotypes becoming more nuanced as they age.\n- Educational environments favor higher-SES students, reinforcing stereotypes and leading to disparities in academic performance.\n- Cross-national studies show that countries with greater inequality exhibit more ambivalent stereotypes.\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. **Social Class Stereotypes:**\n   - Stereotypes attribute well-being, intelligence, and health to high-SES individuals, while low-SES individuals are often viewed as lazy or incompetent.\n   - Racial biases intersect with class stereotypes, particularly regarding welfare recipients.\n\n2. **Development in Children:**\n   - Children develop preferences for wealthier peers and associate competence with wealth by age six.\n   - Adolescents show a more complex understanding of wealth and poverty, often attributing societal factors to poverty.\n\n3. **Academic Consequences:**\n   - Stereotype threat affects the performance of lower-SES students, leading to poorer academic outcomes and reduced self-esteem.\n   - Teachers may hold biases against low-SES students, impacting their educational experiences and outcomes.\n\n4. **Institutionalization of Social Classes:**\n   - Education systems reinforce SC inequality, with middle-class cultural norms shaping academic expectations and performance assessments.\n   - Low-SES students face barriers in higher education, often feeling out of place due to unfamiliar middle-class norms.\n\n5. **Cross-Class Encounters:**\n   - Interactions across class lines can reinforce stereotypes, with higher-SES individuals often seen as cold and lower-SES individuals perceived as warm but incompetent.\n   - Social behaviors are influenced by SC, affecting how individuals interact and perceive each other.\n\n6. **Ambivalent Stereotypes and National Inequality:**\n   - Nations with high income inequality exhibit complex stereotypes that justify and stabilize unequal systems.\n   - More equal societies tend to have simpler, more positive stereotypes of their citizens.\n\n**Conclusions and Future Directions:**\n- Addressing SC stereotypes is crucial for reducing inequality. \n- Interventions should focus on constructive cross-class contact and awareness of stereotype threat.\n- Future research should explore the privileges of higher-SES individuals and the dynamics of cross-class interactions, particularly in diverse, non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) contexts. \n\n**Highlights:**\n- Social class stereotypes portray low-income individuals as less competent but sometimes warmer.\n- These stereotypes affect academic performance and reinforce systemic inequalities.\n- Cross-class interactions often confirm existing stereotypes, complicating social dynamics.\n\n]]",

Hatzenbuehler (Harvard University)\n- Mahzarin R. Banaji (Harvard University)\n\n**Research Overview:**\n- The study analyzes language usage from 1900 to 2015 to assess how stereotypes associated with social groups have changed.\n- The research distinguishes between \"manifest\" content (visible language) and \"latent\" content (underlying meanings and associations).\n\n**Findings:**\n1. **Manifest vs. Latent Content:**\n   - Stereotypes have changed significantly in manifest content (e.g., the words used), but latent content (the underlying meanings) has remained stable.\n   - Example: Stereotypes of Black Americans transitioned from \"lazy\" in the 1900s to \"helpless\" in the 1990s, maintaining a negative connotation of incompetence.\n\n2. **Word Embeddings:**\n   - The researchers utilized word embeddings to analyze how words are related based on their usage in text, showing that biases persist over time.\n   - The study highlights that words associated with youth are linked to positive traits, while those related to aging are linked to negative traits.\n\n3. **Data Collection:**\n   - The researchers compiled a dataset spanning 115 years from sources like Google Books, The New York Times, and Common Crawl.\n   - They focused on 72 social groups categorized into sociodemographic, body-related, mental-health-related, and occupational groups.\n\n4. **Stereotype Change Patterns:**\n   - Stereotypes for sociodemographic groups changed more than those for body-related groups.\n   - Stereotypes that are consistently portrayed across various media sources tend to remain unchanged.\n\n5. **Impact of Frequency:**\n   - Groups that are mentioned more frequently in discourse see greater changes in both manifest and latent stereotypes.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n- Despite visible changes in language, deep-rooted biases and inequities persist, highlighting a paradox of social progress.\n- The research suggests that addressing the underlying meanings of stereotypes is essential for meaningful social change.\n\n**Future Research Directions:**\n- Investigating methods to disrupt persistent stigmatization and address the latent meanings of stereotypes.\n\n**Publication Reference:**\n- Charlesworth, T.

Negative stereotypes about subordinated groups are internalized and manifest as implicit bias.\n\n2. **Stratification Theory**: The chapter posits stratification theory as a framework to understand how societal structures perpetuate negative racial norms and stereotypes, reinforcing racial hierarchies.\n\n3. **Research Findings**: \n   - Studies show that black applicants face discrimination in hiring, even when equally qualified, as demonstrated by Pager and Western's job audit study.\n   - \"Ban the box\" policies, intended to reduce discrimination against formerly incarcerated individuals, may inadvertently worsen outcomes for black applicants without criminal records due to reliance on racial stereotypes.\n\n4. **Traffic Policing Data**: \n   - Racial disparities in traffic stops reveal that black drivers are significantly more likely to be stopped, searched, and arrested compared to white drivers, indicating systemic bias.\n   - The \"veil of darkness\" and \"hit rate\" tests are used to assess racial bias in policing, showing that black drivers are often searched without justifiable cause.\n\n5. **Implicit Bias and Stereotyping**: \n   - Implicit Association Tests (IAT) and shooter bias tests reveal that individuals often have unconscious biases that influence their perceptions and actions, contributing to discriminatory behavior in policing.\n   - Research indicates that negative racial stereotypes persist in society, affecting how individuals perceive and interact with different racial groups.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The chapter argues for a deeper understanding of the origins and impacts of racial stereotypes, suggesting that economic models need to incorporate insights from social psychology to better explain the complex nature of racial discrimination.\n\n7. **References**: The chapter cites several key studies and theories, including Allport's contact theory, Blumer's group position theory, and various empirical studies highlighting the relationship between racial stereotypes and discrimination.\n\nOverall, Seguino emphasizes the need for a theoretical framework that acknowledges the role of social psychology in understanding and addressing racial discrimination, particularly in economic contexts.]]",
