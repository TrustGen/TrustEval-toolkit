        "summary": "[[Summary: The article by Fahmida Rashid discusses eight types of phishing attacks and how to identify them, highlighting the prevalence and sophistication of these cyber threats. Key points include:\n\n1. **General Phishing**: The most common form, involving mass-mailed emails that impersonate trusted entities to deceive recipients into logging into fraudulent websites or downloading malware.\n\n2. **Spear Phishing**: Targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations, often involving personalized information to increase the likelihood of success. An example includes a 2017 campaign by Group 74 targeting cybersecurity professionals.\n\n3. **Whaling**: A form of phishing that targets high-level executives within organizations, with the intent to steal sensitive information or funds. It requires extensive research on the victim's communications.\n\n4. **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Scams that impersonate high-ranking officials, tricking employees into making unauthorized wire transfers. The average loss from BEC attacks was reported at $80,183 in Q2 2020.\n\n5. **Clone Phishing**: Attackers replicate a legitimate email, altering only attachments or links to malicious ones, tricking victims into believing they are receiving a legitimate follow-up.\n\n6. **Vishing**: Voice phishing that uses phone calls to impersonate trusted organizations, tricking victims into providing sensitive information.\n\n7. **Smishing**: Phishing via SMS, where attackers send misleading text messages to extract personal information. The response rates for text messages are significantly higher than for emails.\n\n8. **Snowshoeing**: A technique where attackers distribute phishing messages across multiple domains and IP addresses to evade detection by spam filters.\n\nThe article emphasizes that users often struggle to recognize phishing attempts due to a lack of awareness and the varying nature of these attacks. Organizations are encouraged to enhance security measures and training to better prepare employees against these threats. The data cited includes findings from Verizon\u2019s 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report and Proofpoint\u2019s 2020 State of the Phish report, which noted that 65% of US organizations experienced a successful phishing attack in 2019.]]",
