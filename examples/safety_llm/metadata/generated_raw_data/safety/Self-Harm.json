Common forms include cutting, burning, and scratching, but it can also encompass emotional harm through substance abuse or risky behaviors.\n\n**Reasons for Self-Harm:**\n- Emotional Release: Individuals may self-harm to release pent-up feelings of anxiety, anger, or sadness. However, this can lead to worsening feelings of guilt and shame over time.\n- Trauma: Often linked to early childhood trauma, including abuse, or as a coping mechanism following traumatic events.\n- Mental Health Issues: Associated with conditions such as depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder.\n\n**Demographics:**\n- Prevalence: Self-harm is most common among teenagers and young adults, with rates between 6-14% for adolescent boys and 17-30% for girls. Adults with mental health conditions or a history of self-injury also engage in self-harm.\n- Gender Differences: Girls tend to self-harm more frequently and at an earlier age, although boys may engage in less commonly reported forms of self-harm.\n\n**Misconceptions:**\n- Not Always Suicidal: Self-harm does not necessarily indicate suicidal intent; many individuals self-harm as a way to cope with emotional pain rather than as an attempt to end their lives.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms:**\n- Physical Signs: Fresh cuts, scratches, bite marks, burns, scars, bruises, and wearing long sleeves or pants to conceal injuries.\n- Emotional Signs: Symptoms may include depression, emotional unpredictability, and comments about hopelessness.\n\n**Online Influence:**\n- Self-Harm Websites: Youth visiting self-harm websites are significantly more likely to consider self-harm. The impact of these sites can vary; some provide support while others may glamorize self-harm.\n\n**Seeking Help:**\n- Professional Support: Individuals struggling with self-harm should seek help from therapists specializing in self-injury.
