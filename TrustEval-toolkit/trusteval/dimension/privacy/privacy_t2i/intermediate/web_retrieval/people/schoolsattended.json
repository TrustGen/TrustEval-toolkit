        "summary": "[[Summary: \nThe article by Daniel Buck, published on October 5, 2023, addresses the significant threat that artificial intelligence (AI) poses to student privacy in educational settings. While much of the discourse surrounding AI in education focuses on academic integrity and cheating, Buck emphasizes the overlooked risks related to student privacy.\n\nKey Points:\n1. **AI and Student Privacy**: Buck illustrates the potential dangers of AI through a hypothetical scenario involving a student monitored by a \"Robo-Coach\" that utilizes personal data to predict behavior and intervene in real-time. This raises concerns about the extent of surveillance and data collection in schools.\n\n2. **Chronic Absenteeism**: The article notes that chronic absenteeism is a pressing issue in education, with AI potentially offering solutions by sending alerts to parents about their children's academic performance and attendance. However, this requires access to extensive personal data, including messages, GPS location, and biometric information.\n\n3. **Data Dependency of AI**: The effectiveness of AI systems is reliant on the data they are trained on, which raises questions about data privacy and security. Buck compares AI's need for data to the need for electricity in power plants, underscoring the critical nature of data in AI functionality.\n\n4. **International Examples**: Buck references practices in some Chinese schools where students wear biofeedback devices to monitor their emotional states, highlighting concerns about the invasive nature of such surveillance technologies.\n\n5. **Concerns about Surveillance**: Drawing on Michel Foucault's concept of the Panopticon, Buck discusses the psychological effects of constant surveillance on students, suggesting it may inhibit free expression and foster a negative school environment.\n\n6. **Current Regulations Insufficient**: Buck criticizes existing regulations like FERPA for being inadequate in addressing the complexities of student privacy in the age of AI. He advocates for clearer consent forms, robust data protection regulations, and legal repercussions for data mishandling.\n\n7. **Future Considerations**: The article poses critical questions about the future of student data, such as whether data will become public utilities, the potential for \"freedom of thought\" legal frameworks, and the implications of student \"credit scores\" being shared with law enforcement.\n\n8. **Call to Action**: Buck warns against dismissing generative AI as a passing trend, urging policymakers to create frameworks that protect student privacy while allowing the beneficial use of AI in education.\n\nAuthor Background: Daniel Buck is a senior visiting fellow at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute and serves as an assistant principal at a classical charter school. He has authored works on educational issues and holds a master\u2019s degree in curriculum and instruction from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.]]",
