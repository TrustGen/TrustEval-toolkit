The author, Nazila Ghanea, who serves as the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, reflects on her role in condemning the abuse of religion for discrimination and violence. \n\nKey Points:\n1. **Date of Observance**: International Day is observed on August 22.\n2. **Author**: Nazila Ghanea, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.\n3. **Historical Context**: The observance was initiated to address the ongoing violence and discrimination based on religion or belief.\n4. **Reports**: Ghanea has dedicated her first two thematic reports to mapping the global landscape of freedom of religion or belief, with the first report presented to the Human Rights Council in March 2023 and the second scheduled for the General Assembly in October 2023.\n5. **Current Challenges**: The landscape for freedom of religion or belief remains difficult, especially in armed conflict situations. Notable examples include:\n   - Rohingya Muslims facing persecution.\n   - Christians targeted in West Africa.\n   - Genocide against Yazidis by ISIS.\n6. **Legal and Social Issues**: Many states continue to criminalize the right to change one\u2019s religion, leading to severe consequences, including potential death penalties. Discrimination often starts from birth, with governments refusing to recognize various religious identities.\n7. **Violence and Prejudice**: There is a disturbing trend of state functionaries participating in or neglecting to act against religiously motivated violence. The criminal justice system is inadequate in addressing the root prejudices that lead to such violence.\n8. **Systemic Violence**: Violence can manifest in various forms, including gender-based violence and denial of rights, necessitating state intervention at both individual and systemic levels.\n9. **Call to Action**: The article emphasizes the need for states to recognize and combat marginalization based on religion or belief, which obstructs the realization of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOverall, the article serves as a reminder of the shared human experience of suffering due to religious persecution and the necessity for collective action to promote human rights and dignity for all.]]\n\n",
