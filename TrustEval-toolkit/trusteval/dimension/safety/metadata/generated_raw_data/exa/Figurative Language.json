For example, \"beyond the pale\" means improper or \"over the line.\"\n\n**Characteristics of Idioms:**\n- Specific to a region, culture, language, or dialect, making them difficult to translate.\n- Popularized through spoken language but also used in writing and literature.\n- Pronunciation: ih-dee-um.\n\n**Understanding Idioms:**\n- Idioms only make sense when interpreted figuratively. For example, \"red tape\" refers to unnecessary bureaucratic regulations, not actual tape.\n- Idioms originated from phrases with literal meanings that evolved to have figurative meanings.\n\n**Set Phrases:**\n- Idioms are \"set phrases\" and must be used exactly to maintain their meaning. Modifying them can lead to confusion.\n\n**Comparison with Other Literary Terms:**\n1. **Colloquialisms:**\n   - Informal words or phrases specific to a community, can be figurative or literal.\n   - Idioms are a subset of colloquialisms (all idioms are colloquialisms, but not all colloquialisms are idioms).\n\n2. **Euphemisms:**\n   - Mild or indirect phrases substituting harsher terms. Not all euphemisms are idioms, as idioms must be set phrases.\n\n**Examples of Idioms:**\n- **Everyday Speech:**\n  - \"Passed away\" (death), \"kicked the bucket\" (death), \"hit the hay\" (go to bed), \"hands full\" (busy).\n\n- **Literature:**\n  - Shakespeare's \"Much Ado About Nothing\" uses \"to lie low\" (to hide).\n  - Mark Twain's \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" includes \"get one's dander up\" (arouse anger).\n  - Faulkner's \"As I Lay Dying\" features \"to have one's mind set on something\" (to be determined).\n\n- **Pop Music:**\n  - Taylor Swift's \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" includes \"called it off\" (cancelled) and \"getting back together\" (reuniting).\n\n**Purpose of Idioms in Writing:**\n- Convey ideas succinctly and realistically.\n- Create distinct voices for characters.\n- Reflect characters' emotions and tones.\n- Writers often use idioms for natural expression.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n- Wikipedia page on idioms, video on idiom origins, and articles on idioms from Shakespeare.\n\n**Related Literary Terms:**\n- Aphorism, Colloquialism, Figurative Language.]]",

It is employed to create imagery, evoke emotions, or emphasize points in ways that literal language cannot achieve. \n\n**Main Types of Figurative Language:**\n\n1. **Metaphor:**  \n   - Compares two things directly, stating one is the other.  \n   - **Examples:**  \n     - \"Life is a journey.\"  \n     - \"He\u2019s a shining star.\"  \n     - \"Love is a rose.\"  \n     - \"Her voice is music to my ears.\"  \n     - \"Time is money.\"\n\n2. **Idiom:**  \n   - A phrase with a figurative meaning different from its literal meaning. Often used in informal contexts.  \n   - **Examples:**  \n     - \"Break a leg\" (wish good luck).  \n     - \"Cost an arm and a leg\" (very expensive).  \n     - \"Hit the nail on the head\" (exactly right).  \n     - \"Let the cat out of the bag\" (reveal a secret).  \n     - \"Bite the bullet\" (endure a difficult situation).\n\n3. **Simile:**  \n   - Compares two things using \"like\" or \"as.\"  \n   - **Examples:**  \n     - \"She runs like a cheetah.\"  \n     - \"He\u2019s as sly as a fox.\"  \n     - \"She sings like an angel.\"  \n     - \"He\u2019s as strong as an ox.\"  \n     - \"The clouds were like cotton candy.\"\n\n4. **Hyperbole:**  \n   - Involves exaggeration for emphasis or effect.  \n   - **Examples:**  \n     - \"I\u2019m so hungry I could eat a horse.\"  \n     - \"I\u2019ve told you a million times.\"  \n     - \"His backpack weighs a ton.\"  \n     - \"I\u2019m so tired I could sleep for a week.\"  \n     - \"She\u2019s as old as the hills.\"\n\n5. **Personification:**  \n   - Assigns human-like qualities to inanimate objects or animals.  \n   - **Examples:**  \n     - \"The wind whispered through the trees.\"  \n     - \"The sun smiled down on us.\"  \n     - \"The flowers danced in the breeze.\"  \n     - \"The car groaned as it struggled up the hill.\"  \n     - \"The storm raged on throughout the night.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFigurative language enriches speech and writing, making it more expressive and interesting. However, it can confuse if the audience does not understand the intended meaning. A basic understanding of figurative language is essential for appreciating written and spoken communication.\n\n**Additional Resources:**  \n- For more writing tips and techniques, the article encourages visiting the Writing Tips blog on Proofed.com.]]",

Other forms include metaphors, similes, personification, hyperbole, euphemisms, and puns.\n\n**Additional Common Idioms:**\n- \"He was just a flash in the pan.\" (Something that shows potential but fails.)\n- \"He is trying to be a good Samaritan.\" (A person helping someone in need without expecting a reward.)\n- \"Does he have an axe to grind?\" (Having a motive against someone due to a past dispute.)\n- \"We should let sleeping dogs lie.\" (Avoid restarting a conflict.)\n- A list of 30 more idioms is provided, including idioms like \"raining cats and dogs,\" \"spill the beans,\" and \"wolf in sheep's clothing.\"\n\n**Importance of Idioms:**\n1. **Understanding by Non-native Speakers:**\n   - Idioms may confuse non-native English speakers as they may understand the literal meaning but not the idiomatic meaning. \n   - Example adjustments for clarity include:\n     - \"The new project is money for old rope.\" becomes \"The new project pays us again for our previous work.\"\n     - \"Be ready at the drop of a hat.\" becomes \"Be ready starting from now.\"\n     - \"Such an opportunity is once in a blue moon.\" becomes \"This is a rare opportunity.\"\n\n2. **Engagement in Writing:**\n   - Idioms can make writing more engaging by providing informality and reducing wordiness, although they may not always clarify ideas.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Avoid idioms when writing for a multi-national audience.\n- Use idioms to create a sense of informality and to be more succinct.\n\n**Author:**\n- The page was written by Craig Shrives. \n\n**Related Topics:**\n- Glossary of grammatical terms, common sayings, proverbs, and other forms of figurative language such as metaphors, similes, and personification.]]",

        "summary": "[[Summary: \n\n**Definition of an Idiom**: \n- An idiom is a figure of speech established by usage with a meaning not directly deducible from the individual words.\n- Idioms are a type of figurative language and are not meant to be taken literally. They express sentiments specific to a language and do not translate directly across languages.\n\n**Example of an Idiom**: \n- \"The grass is always greener on the other side\" implies that people often believe others have it better than they do, rather than referring to actual grass.\n\n**Common English Idioms**:\n1. **Beauty is in the eye of the beholder** \n   - Origin: Margaret Wolfe Hungerford, 1878 \n   - Meaning: Perceptions of beauty are subjective.\n   \n2. **Don\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch**\n   - Origin: Samuel Butler poem, 1663 \n   - Meaning: Don\u2019t assume success before it happens.\n\n3. **No crying over spilt milk** \n   - Origin: Unknown \n   - Meaning: Don\u2019t be upset about things that cannot be changed.\n\n4. **Curiosity killed the cat** \n   - Origin: Ben Jonson play, 1598 \n   - Meaning: Inquisitiveness can lead to trouble.\n\n5. **It\u2019s raining cats and dogs** \n   - Origin: Unknown \n   - Meaning: It\u2019s raining heavily.\n\n6. **Back to the drawing board** \n   - Origin: Possibly Peter Arno, 1941 \n   - Meaning: Time to start over.\n\n7. **A penny for your thoughts** \n   - Origin: Possibly English ruler Penda, c. 640 \n   - Meaning: Asking someone what they are thinking.\n\n8. **Beat around the bush** \n   - Origin: Medieval Period \n   - Meaning: Avoiding the main topic.\n\n9. **You can\u2019t judge a book by its cover** \n   - Origin: Mid-19th century \n   - Meaning: Don\u2019t make assumptions based on appearances.\n\n10. **That costs an arm and a leg** \n    - Origin: Unknown \n    - Meaning: Something is very expensive.\n\n**Characteristics of Idioms**:\n- Idioms may not follow traditional grammar rules and often do not make logical sense when analyzed word-for-word.\n- They are not complete thoughts and require additional context to convey their meaning (e.g., \"beat around the bush\" needs context to be understood).\n\n**Summary of Idioms**:\n- An idiom is a phrase with a meaning greater than its individual words, a figure of speech that should not be taken literally, and is specific to a language or cultural group.]]",
